- **Advanced manipulator types**: Some VR-specific manipulators may be missing

#### Validation Gaps
- Limited testing of complex rain/thermal/wiper configurations
- Need validation against actual X-Plane 12 import behavior
- Missing edge case handling for new features

### 3. Test Coverage and Quality Assurance

#### Test Suite Issues
- **Disabled tests**: Core export functionality tests are disabled
- **Missing integration tests**: No comprehensive X-Plane 12 feature tests
- **Limited compatibility tests**: Need systematic Blender 4+ testing

#### Documentation Gaps
- User migration guide from legacy versions
- Feature documentation for new X-Plane 12 systems
- Developer documentation for validation systems

## üîß Detailed Action Plan
